Dashboard Slow on Chrome,Dashboard takes 30+ seconds to load in Chrome browser. Safari and Firefox are normal. Likely frontend issue.
API Response Time Degraded,API endpoints responding in 2-3 seconds instead of normal 200ms. Database queries are slow. May need indexing.

Add Webhook Support,Users need webhook endpoints for integrations with Zapier and IFTTT. Currently no API for notifications.
OAuth2 Client Credentials,Implement client credentials flow for service-to-service authentication. Current JWT-only approach limits integrations.
Rate Limiting API,API needs rate limiting to prevent abuse. Currently anyone can make unlimited requests.
API Documentation Missing,Swagger/OpenAPI docs are outdated. Many endpoints not documented. Developers requesting current specs.
GraphQL Endpoint Needed,Some users prefer GraphQL over REST API. Should add GraphQL endpoint alongside REST.
Improve Error Messages,API error messages are technical and unhelpful. Need user-friendly error responses with recovery suggestions.
Add Pagination to Results,API returns all results which causes timeouts. Need cursor-based pagination or limit parameters.
Field Validation Weak,API accepts invalid data formats. Email fields accept anything. Need stricter schema validation.

Database Schema Documentation,Database ER diagram missing. Developers working on integrations need to understand data model.
Integration Guide Needed,Partners need step-by-step integration guide with code examples. Currently only raw API docs.
