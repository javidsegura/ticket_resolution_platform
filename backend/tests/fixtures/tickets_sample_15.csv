Unable to Access Dashboard,Users report that the dashboard page is not loading. They see a blank white screen after logging in. This started happening after the latest deployment yesterday. Error appears in both Chrome and Firefox browsers.
Email Notifications Not Sending,Email notifications for ticket updates are not being sent to users. The system shows notifications as "sent" in the logs but recipients confirm they never received them. This affects all notification types including assignment and status change emails.
Search Function Returns No Results,The search functionality is returning no results even when tickets clearly match the search terms. Users have tried various keywords and filters but nothing appears. This is affecting productivity as users cannot find existing tickets.
File Upload Fails for Large Files,When users try to upload files larger than 10MB, the upload fails with a generic error message. The progress bar reaches 100% but then shows an error. Smaller files upload successfully. Need to either increase limit or provide better error messaging.
API Rate Limit Too Restrictive,Third-party integrations are hitting rate limits after just 10 requests per minute. This is too restrictive for automated workflows. Need to increase limits or provide a way to request higher limits for enterprise customers.
User Permissions Not Working Correctly,Some users with "Editor" role cannot edit tickets they created. The edit button is visible but clicking it shows an "Access Denied" error. This is inconsistent - some editors can edit while others cannot.
Mobile App Crashes on iOS,The mobile application crashes immediately after opening on iOS devices running version 17.0 and above. Android users are not experiencing this issue. Crash logs show a memory allocation error in the image rendering component.
Database Query Timeout,Complex reports are timing out after 30 seconds. The queries involve multiple joins across large tables. This started happening after we migrated to the new database server. Need query optimization or increased timeout limits.
Webhook Delivery Failing,Webhooks configured for ticket events are not being delivered to external endpoints. The webhook status shows "pending" but never changes to "delivered" or "failed". This breaks integrations with Zapier and other automation tools.
Export to PDF Not Working,The export to PDF feature generates corrupted files. Users can download the file but it cannot be opened in any PDF viewer. The file size appears correct but the content is unreadable. This affects both individual tickets and bulk exports.
Real-time Updates Not Syncing,When multiple users view the same ticket, changes made by one user are not appearing for others until they manually refresh the page. The real-time sync feature that was working last week has stopped functioning.
Password Reset Link Expires Too Quickly,Password reset links expire after just 1 hour. Users report that by the time they check their email and click the link, it has already expired. Need to extend expiration time to at least 24 hours or provide a way to request a new link.
Calendar Integration Missing,Users need to sync ticket due dates with their Google Calendar or Outlook. Currently there is no calendar integration available. This is a frequently requested feature for better deadline management.
Ticket Assignment Not Notifying,When tickets are assigned to users, they are not receiving any notification. The assignment appears in the system but users only discover it when they manually check their assigned tickets. Email and in-app notifications are both not working.
Dark Mode Causes UI Glitches,When dark mode is enabled, several UI elements become invisible or hard to read. Text colors are not properly adjusted for dark backgrounds. Some buttons are completely hidden because they use white text on white backgrounds.
